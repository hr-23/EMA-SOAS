The Problem
Why did I Choose this Problem ?
Context:
The problem faced by TCS, as highlighted in the Economic Times article, TCS faces a significant skills gap, with 80,000
unfilled positions due to mismatched employee skills and project needs, leading to reliance on costly contractors.
Onboarding delays for over 10,000 freshers further exacerbate the issue. These problems result in increased operational
costs, reduced productivity, low employee morale, and decreased client satisfaction, putting TCS at a competitive
disadvantage. Addressing these issues is crucial for optimizing workforce utilization, reducing costs, and improving overall
business performance.
