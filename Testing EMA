Testing Ema SAOS and Validating Hypotheses
To quickly test Ema SAOS and validate its hypotheses, we will start with a pilot program focusing on a small, manageable
group within TCS. Here’s the step-by-step approach:
Select a Pilot Group: Identify a department or project team with a known skills gap and onboarding delays.
1.
Data Collection: Gather relevant data on employee profiles, job descriptions, current skillsets, and project
requirements.
2.
Baseline Metrics: Establish baseline metrics for time-to-fill positions, training effectiveness, onboarding duration,
employee satisfaction, and project delivery timelines.
3.
Deploy Ema SAOS: Integrate Ema SAOS with the department’s HR systems and start the GenAI-driven processes for
skill gap analysis, personalized upskilling, and onboarding management.
4.
Monitor and Measure: Track the performance of Ema SAOS against the baseline metrics, focusing on the speed and
accuracy of skill gap identification, training completion rates, onboarding times, and overall productivity.
5.
Feedback Collection: Collect feedback from employees, HR, and managers on the effectiveness and ease of use of Ema
SAOS.
